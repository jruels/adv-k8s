# Install Kubernetes on AWS
## Log into all servers 
### MacOS

## Install Kubernetes on all servers

Following commands must be run as the root user. To become root run: 
```
sudo su - 
```

Install packages required for Kubernetes on all servers as the root user
```
apt-get update && apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add -
```

Create Kubernetes repository by running the following as one command.
```
echo "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
```

Now that you've added the repository install the packages
```
apt-get update
apt-get install -y kubelet=1.20.2-00 kubeadm=1.20.2-00 kubectl
```

The kubelet is now restarting every few seconds, as it waits in a `crashloop` for `kubeadm` to tell it what to do.

### Initialize the Master 
Run the following command on the master node to initialize 
```
kubeadm init --kubernetes-version=1.20.2 --ignore-preflight-errors=all
```

If everything was successful output will contain 
````
Your Kubernetes master has initialized successfully!
````

Note the `kubeadm join...` command, it will be needed later on.

Exit to ubuntu user 
```
exit
```

Now configure server so you can interact with Kubernetes as the unprivileged user. 
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

Run following on the master to enable IP forwarding to IPTables.
```
sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1
```

### Pod overlay network
Install a Pod network on the master node
```
kubectl apply -f "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '\n')"
```

Wait until `coredns` pod is in a `running` state
```
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

### Join nodes to cluster 
Log into each of the worker nodes and run the join command from `kubeadm init` master output. 
```
sudo kubeadm join <command from kubeadm init output> --ignore-preflight-errors=all
```

To confirm nodes have joined successfully log back into master and run 
```
kubectl get nodes -w
````

When they are in a `Ready` state the cluster is online and nodes have been joined. 

To stop watching type `ctrl+c`
